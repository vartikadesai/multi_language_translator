# Multi language translator

This repository contains a Python project on multi language translator. VoiceTranslation,alsoreferredtoasspeech-to-speechorspeech-to-texttranslation, is  software that can translate human speech from one language into another.Google Translatotron isGoogle's newest translation system,which began development in 2016 as an update over its previous speech-to-text and text-to-speech services.The system aims to optimize translation processes and overcome common hurdles, including translation speed,compounding errors in recognition and translation, ability to retain original speaker voice post translation,and detection of words that do not need to be translated.
 
 As voice translation can act as an intermediary for two people holding a conversation in different languages,the technology can be used and has been extended to use in customer support services.Depending on the translation technology,the implementation of voice translation technology can offer users a text-based translation of speech, while others can offer translation over voice to another member of the chat.
